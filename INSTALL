Dat CLI installation instructions

Method 1: Self contained binary

- This method does not require installing Node.js or npm
- Download the latest release zip for your platform (self contained binary) from https://github.com/datproject/dat/releases
- Extract the zip
- On a command line run: ./path-to-extracted-zip/dat
- Make sure to leave all files in the extracted zip in their original location

Linux/Mac: Add to your PATH so you can just run 'dat' instead of './path-to-extracted-zip/dat':

- On a command line run: cd ./path-to-extracted-zip
- Run: pwd
- Use the path printed out above to add this line to your `.bash_profile', e.g.:

PATH=/Users/maxogden/Downloads/dat-13.9.2-macos-x64/:$PATH

- Reload your terminal and you should just be able to run 'dat' from any folder now.

Method 2 (recommended for easy updates): npm

- Install http://nodejs.org/
- On a command line run: npm install dat --global
- You should now have dat installed, try running: dat
