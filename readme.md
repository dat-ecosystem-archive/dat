## collaborative data

`dat` is currently pre-alpha. You can test it out or hack on it now, but all things are subject to change.

To learn more about `dat` please read [what is `dat`?](what-is-dat.md).

# Hacking on dat

If you are interested in testing out the pre-alpha version of `dat` you can install it using `npm` (which usually gets installed when you [install `node`](http://nodejs.org/))

`dat` is primarily intended as a command line tool. There is also a programmatic API that you can use in node.js programs for more advanced use cases, as well as a way to have `dat` call programs written in other programming languages to transform data.

## Install

To get the currently published version (recommended):

```
npm install dat -g
```

The `-g` means "install globally" which makes the `dat` command available in your command line path.

You can also install the latest development version with `git`:

```
git clone git://github.com/maxogden/dat.git
cd dat
npm install
npm link
```

### How to use `dat`
