dat write <location>

  DEPRECATED. Use `dat add` instead

Usage:
  Write binary data into dat. This differs from `import` in that it doesn't parse the file, it just stores it as a binary attachment. `import` is designed for tabular data or key/value data. `write` is meant for large files, blobs, or attachments that you can't parse into rows. Files will appear as links in the same directory as `data.dat`.

Paramters:

  <location> (required)

    The local filename or URL of the resource to stream into the dat blob store. If location is '-', dat will accept data on stdin.

Options

  --message=<text> (-m)

    Provide a message for the new version upon result of the operation.

  --key=<name>

    The key by which to reference the data later. If not supplied, uses the name of the file. (e.g., /Users/karissa/docs/banana.jpg -> 'banana.jpg')
